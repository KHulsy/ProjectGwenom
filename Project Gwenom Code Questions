                                      Ten Code Questions:

1. Write one paragraph telling me about your favorite music video or film. Think about the special effects. Name the video or the movie. Tell me the artist. Tell me why 
it kept your attention. As you write it, I want you to think about how it was made.

2. What is your favorite game or app on your phone? If you play games on your mom or dad's phone, what do you play? What do you like about it? Why is it fun for you to play?

3. What is your favorite class? What technology do they use that is interesting to you?

4. I know that your teacher sometimes gets mad if your phone is out in class. What makes your phone more interesting than what your teacher is saying? 

4. How do you think a selfie is made and sent? Would it be cool to know that? Tell me why.

5. This is a code block. You can use whatever colors you want, but you have to change the code to do so. Where are the colors? Change them up.

6. When web developers code, they usually use pseudo-code before they start. Pseudo-code is like a list of directions to building cool stuff. I want you to think about building an app.
You can build any app you want. What do you think you would do first? There is no right or wrong answer. Give me three steps, numbered. 
//This is where your code starts.//
