    <h1>Statement On Black Lives Matter and Immigrant Rights</h1>
    <p>At Siren Song Productions, we are in full support of Black Lives Matter. There is no acceptable justification for the systematic killing of people of color. We support every protester who is tired of police brutality. We are allies to those who know that change doesn't come with silence. Siren Song Productions knows that immigrants are the backbone of our country. We continue to weep for children in cages, and we question the moral compass of a president who continues to punish children, while referring to white nationalists as "great people". We hope that art, conversation,and participation at the ballot box this November will bring the America we know and love back to the forefront of our world.</p>
