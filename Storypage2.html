      <h1></h1>
      <p> The witch was the meanest of all them. I mean, she had to be.There was no way in, and there was no way out. Lost girls just kind of appeared out of nowhere and she took them under her wings. SHE ALWAYS DID! She was good.Bad wrap, that's all. 
     She didn't EAT the children, per se. That was a horrifically unfair stereotype brought on by the crazy old biddy who covered her flat in syntactic sugar to lure them in. That little hellian Gretel had ruined her.Made
     her so crazy that when they escaped she started burning scraps of trash in her oven. Big fire. Cinders everywhere.<p>
     
     <p>All these nice girls just appear and try to live their lives quietly, and you think you're the girl on fire? 
     And don't you go swimming yourself out of here. You're stuck.Your dress is a tatter, and you look a ratchet mess. Clean yourself up and get Witchie's spirits up. <p>
     <p> You've got a lot of questions. I don't have time.You want some sugar? Listen, mouthy. I'll make a deal with you.
      Take the quiz and I'll let you go. Because I know how. Look,the sea witch and I are good. Did her some favors. Got her some souls.
      <p> Relax. She doesn't want yours. Yet. So what's it gonna be, princess?<p>
